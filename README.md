# Quantum-Screen-Theater

This project has been developed as a submission for Assigment 02 of Principles of Programming Module [MCS 1205].

This project implements a theater seat reservation system in C. The system allows users add shows to the schedule, to reserve seats for a show with different seat categories (Economy, Twin, VIP, and VVIP) available and view reservations. The reservation process updates the show's revenue and updates the seat availability.
